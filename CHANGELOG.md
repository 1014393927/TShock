## TShock 4.3.0.0

* Updated prebuilts (SQLite, JSON, MySQL) to latest versions. (@nicatronTg)
* Added a minimum password length to prevent blank passwords. (@nicatronTg)
* Modified item ban checks to provide which item is disabling a player in the logs. (@Enerdy)
* API: Modified TSPlayer to store a user, and deprecated calls to TSPlayer.User.ID. (@WhiteXZ)

* Terraria 1.3.0.3 support.
